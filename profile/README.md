### Task 1

Colab link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xUi-gjI3hSLqNQruX1G94IzxBEMQbVD4?usp=sharing

So far we have trained the AI model on non-augmented images from the default dataset using tensorflow.

Here is a screenshot of prediction versus truth:

Here is image of the evaluation towards the test-set:

### Task 2

Repository link: https://github.com/StartHack2024/part2-python

We tried using earth engine in a python notebook.

So far we have just experimented with different types of ways to visualize the data, and also exporting the landmass data as csv files for use in the future:

### Task 3

Repository link: https://github.com/StartHack2024/website

We have just finished the basic implementation using typescript + React + vite.

Here is a screenshot of how the web-panel currently looks, using mapbox to display the earth map with geotiff layers added dynamically:

You can also zoom in on the map to see more details:

We are now just about to start with UI design for the web-panel.
