## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Task 2

We tried using earth engine in a python notebook at https://github.com/StartHack2024/part2-python

So far we have just experimented with different types of ways to visualize the data, and also exporting the landmass data as csv files for use in the future:

### Task 3

We have just finished the basic implementation using typescript + React + vite.

Here is a screenshot of how the web-panel currently looks, using mapbox to display the earth map with geotiff layers added dynamically:

You can also zoom in on the map to see more details:

We are now just about to start with UI design for the web-panel.
